# Getting Started with DDF

<div class="body">

To get started with DDF, you install _agents_ and you create _access points_ and _data stores_ on local systems. You create _data flows_ that contain _actions_ to connect the data stores and perform operations on your data as it moves from data store to data store.

- [Adding a Data Store](../Tasks/DDF_AddingDataStores_task.html) _Data Stores_ are the file transfer end points for your DDF system. They reside on _Access Points_.
- [Creating Data Flows](../Tasks/DDF_CreatingDataFlows_task.html) A _data flow_ connects two _data stores_data stores such that files can be transferred between them.
